Including mathematical notations in your post is possible thanks to KaTeX.  
To add a math notation all you need to do is add `$$` signs at the beginning and end of the notation.

```
$$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi$$
```  
Will produce the following notations,  

$$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi$$  

Math can be fun for sure!
